#### 3. Analysis Questions

1. How did GitHub Actions improve reproducibility?

- GitHub Actions ensured that every experiment ran in a fixed, automated environment with the same dependency versions and execution steps, making results reproducible across runs.

2. How easy was it to compare results across runs?

- Comparison was easy because each run produced metrics in the Job Summary and downloadable JSON artifacts, allowing side-by-side inspection.

3. What role does Git commit history play in experiment tracking?

- Each commit represents a unique experiment configuration, providing a clear and traceable history of changes and their corresponding results.

4. Benefits compared to Lab 1

- Unlike Lab 1, experiments were automated, reproducible and centrally logged, reducing manual effort and error.

5. Limitations

- Hyperparameter changes are still manual.
